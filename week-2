Asymptotic Analysis 
- provides basic vocabulary for discussing the design and analysis of algorithms
- it is a sweet spot for high level reasoning about algorithms 
- coarsse enough to suppress architecture/language compiler dependent details 
- sharp enough to make algorithms useful comparisons between different algorithms, especially large inputs (sorting, integer multiplication)
- high level programmes will tell you, asymptotic analysis supresses constant factors and lower order terms
- lovel order terms become irrelevant for large inputs 
- constant factors are too dependent on the environment 

Example:
- equate 6n log2n + 6n with just n log n 
6n log2n +6n 
- we drop 6n
