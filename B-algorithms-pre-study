Algorithms and Data-Structures

algorithms = operations on different data structures and the sets of instructions to executing them 
- depending on what data structure we are using to store data, that we are performing algorithm on our algorithms
may work differently, or completly different algorithm for solving the same problem, because of data structure we are using
