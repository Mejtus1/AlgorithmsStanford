Algorithms and Data-Structures

algorithms = operations on different data structures and the sets of instructions to executing them 
- depending on what data structure we are using to store data, that we are performing algorithm on our algorithms
may work differently, or completly different algorithm for solving the same problem, because of data structure we are using 


Arrays 
[5, 2, 300, 20] = array of integers
["yeah", "ouch", "haha"] = array of strings 

Example code of Arrays 
int sampleArray[5] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 100}
sampleArray[0] = 20; 
sampleArray[1] = -5;
{20, -5, 6, 8, 100}
- in C we cannot add another space for array because of how memory on computer works

Memory 
Memory (RAM) = data is not permanent 
Storage = data is permanent 
- when we work on program in our memory, it needs to be stored in storage to be there after computer shuts down
Why dont we use just storage ? 
- we use memory RAM, because it is temporary and faster
- retrieving everything from storage will be inneficient and slow
Applications 
- are stored in storage, because after shut down our OS they are still there
Lounching Google chrome
- is loaded into memory RAM, because it is faster there
- running too much 

Memory and programming 
- we assign: 
int a = 1;
- if we turn off our computer, this will dissapear because it is only stored in memory 
- each int if is stored in computer it is stored as 32 bit value:
1 = 00000000000000000000000000000001
2 = 00000000000000000000000000000010
3 = 00000000000000000000000000000011
