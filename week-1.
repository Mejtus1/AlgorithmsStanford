MERGE SORT EXPLAINED in DEPTH 

- logarithmic algorithms 
- faster sorting algorithms 
- in easy way, merge sort works by spliting until reached a base case
(base case = [] empty array, [1] one element in array, number 2 split into two 1s (1 = base case of 2))

In merge sort there are 2 sub routines
1. Split
2. Merge

1. Split sub-routine 
n = 8 

          8  
     4          4
  2    2     2     2
1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 

- we have split left and right portion to their base case
- in merge sort we have sorted parts of input array n and they later merge and sort together
- base cases have an answers and return it upwards
- we have 3 splits, number of n 
          8    
     4          4          #1. split 
  2    2     2     2       #2. split   = log(n) = log(8) = 3 and 3 = our splits 
1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1     #3. split 
- logarithms are essential for merge sort, because we just cut in half our n values

        [38,27,43,3]             [9,82,10]
    [38,27]      [43,3]       [9,62]     [10]
  [38]   [27]  [43]   [3]    [9]  [82]     [10]
    [27,38]      [3,43]       [9,82]     [10]
        [3,27,38,43]             [9,10,82]
                [3,9,10,27,38,43,82]

2. Merge part 

Marge and recurrence part 
n = length of combined arrays 
n = 6 length of both lists combined 

Q1 =  1 2 3 
Q2 = -1 0 6 

compare lists MARGE PART 
-1 and 1 
= -1           1. comparison 
1 and 0 
= 0            2. comparison
1 and 6 
= 6            3. comparison 
2 and 6 
= 2            4. comparison 
3 and 6 
= 3            5. comparison 
- we dont do comparison with 6, we just place it in last place 
- both lists are exhausted, we have done the sorting 
TOTAL COMPARISONS 5 which means n-1 comparisons in the worst case 
ANSWER: 
The merge function where n is the length of both lists combined has worst time complexity of n-1 comparisons

RECURRENCE PART 
- all recurrence is is defining what the result of the subproblem is 
- 
- how much work do I do when I'm merging n-1 comparisons 

T(1) = 0 
- T of 1 is zero, because we dont do any work when passed into merge function 
- T of 1 is zero comparisons 
- this is base case 

OUR EXAMPLE: 
T(n) = T(n/2)+T(n/2)+(n-1)
- we can merge together T(n/2) and write it as 2T(n/2)
T(n) = 2T(n/2)+(n-1)
- all we do is split functions, merging -> split functions, merging

T(8) = 2T(8/2)+(8-1)
T(8) = 2T(4)  +  7
- we dont know what T(4) is 
- we know recursive definition
Recursion
- is process of defining problem in terms of (simpler version of) itself
- Merge sort is recursive algorithm that continually splits list in half. 
- if list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (base case)
- if list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke merge sort on both halves
T(8) = 2T(4)  +  7
       2T(4/2) + (4-1)      recursive definition 
       2T(2)   +   3 
       2T(2/2) + (2-1)      recursion
       2T(1)   +  1         2T(1) is zero, this is our base case "2T(1) = 0"
           0   +  1         now we will do our recursion upwards 
           1 
        2(1)+3 = 2          2T(2)   +   3
           2   +   3 
           5
        2(5)  +  7          2T(4)  +  7 // five comarisons in worst case 
        10    +  7   
           17 
        T(8) + 17 
- what we have is 17 comparisons in worst cast when input size is 8 

RECURRENCE 
n = 8 
T(8) = 17 comparisons 

- recursive tree in terms of n 
         n                       1(n-1)      - 1 because we have 1 subproblem
    n/2      n/2                 2(n/2 -1)   - we cannot put n there, because we split downwards 
 n/4  n/4  n/4 n/4               4(n/4 -1)
...   ...  ... ...               .........   - we dont want to hard concrete these numbers 
        i = level                            - expressed this in terms of n 
- we need to keep in mind that n is part of list, and n/2 is list split in half 

1(n-1)     //   2 to power of 0(n-1)    //   2 to power of 0(n2 to power of 0 -1)
2(n/2 -1)  //   2 to power of 1(n/2-1)  //   2 to power of 1(n2 to power of 1 -1)
4(n/4 -1)  //   2 to power of 2(n/4-1)  //   2 to power of 2(n2 to power of 2 -1)
i = level                               - we exchange i for power of 2 in our formula
- we take the sum of all the work we did in all algorithm
new formula we have is: 2 to the power of i(n/2 to the power of i - 1)

SUMMATION: 
log(n) - 1 
------                    
\
/      2(n/2i - 1)
------ 
i = 0 

        8            0 tree level            -->   expressed in terms of log == log(8) = 3
   4          4      1 tree level            -->                                3 - 1 =  2*****
2    2     2     2   2 tree level (second level) = 2*****     
- they both end up number 2, so we can express it with log in our SUMMATION 
      

log(n) - 1 
------                    
\
/      2(n/2i - 1)
------ 
i = 0  ------                    
       \
       /      (2i(n)/2i - 2i)       - 2i gets subtracted 
       ------
            ------                    
             \
             /      n - 2i
            ------ 
                 ------     ------                 
                 \          \
                 /     n  - /      2i
                 ------     ------

LEFT side    RIGHT side 

log(n) - 1   log(n) - 1 
------       ------                 
\            \
/     n  -   /      2i
------       ------
 i = 0       i = 0 
- simplyfing LEFT SIDE SUMMATION 
n (((log(n)-1) - (0) ) + 1)    
- log(n) -1 +1 is zero 
- log(n) - 0 is zero 
- which leaves us with:
n log(n)
- OUR HIGHEST ORDER TERM IN WORST CASE is "n log(n)", this is reason BIG O is "n log(n)"

- simplyfing RIGHT SIDE SUMMATION 
(1+2+4... +2log(n-1))
- this is 
r = 2, k = log(n) - 1
if r > 1     
               r(k+1) - 1 
               ----------
                  r - 1 
- now we simplify and plug in r, k 
(2) ((log(n) - 1) + 1) - 1 
--------------------------
         (2) - 1 

(2) log n - 1 
-------------     - when we have this case we just reap number within log 
      1           - (2) log n becomes n 
- what we are left with is (n - 1)
RIGHT      LEFT   side 
n log(n) - n + 1 comparisons 
- now we have CONCRETE MATHEMATICAL STATEMENT 

n = 8 
8 log(8) - 8 + 1 
  8(3) - 7 
    24 - 7 
      17 = NUMBER OF COMPARISONS we need if our array n = 8, has 8 inputs we are trying to sort
