1. Introduction to Algorithms 
- algorithm is a step by step procedure of solving computational problem 
- program is also a step by step procedure of solving a problem 
- SDLC = software development lifecycle 
Algorithm                     Program 
Deisgn phase of SDLC          Implementation phase of SDLC 
Domain knowledge              Programmer (programmer can also have domain knowledge)
any language                  programming language 
(or mathematical notation)
Hardware/Software/OS          H/S/OS dependent 
idependent 
Analyze                       Testing 

1.1 Priori analysis, Postpriori testing 

Priori Analysis             Posteriori Testing
1. Algorithm                1. Program
2. Independent Language     2. Language dependent 
3. Hardware Independent     3. Hardware dependent 
4. Time & Space Function    4. Watch time & Bytes 

1.2 Characteristics of Algorithm 

Input (algorithm must take some input, 0 or more)
Output (algorithm must generate at least one ouput)
Definitness (Every statement should be ambigious, there cannot be statement that cannot be solved)
( - we cannot use for example value root -1 because we dont know its output too, program cannot either)
Finitness (solution must exist)
Effectivness (there shouldnt be any unnecesarry statements)

1.3 How to write an Algorithm 
- all algorithms are procedures to solve a problem 
Algorithm Swap(a,b)
{ "begin" 
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
} "end" 

How to analyze algorithm 
main criteria: 
1. Time (how much time is it taking)
- algorithm should be time efficient 
2. space (how much memory, space it will consume)
another criteria: 
3. data transfer, network consumption (because today everything is cloud-based)
4. Power comsumption (because of Mobile phones, Ipads and other mobile devices)
5. CPU register is algorithm consuming (how many resistors)

- all criteria depent on project
- every step in the algorithm takes 1 unit of time
{ "begin" 
    temp = a; ------ 1 
    a = b;    ------ 1 
    b = temp; ------ 1 
} "end" 
f(n) = 3 
- when we assign our statement it also is one unit of time 
x = 5 a + 6 b ------- 1 unit of time 

space calculation: 
a ------- 1
b ------- 1 
temp ----1 
S(n) = 3 words = words, because when we convert it into program we dont know if it is going to be 
int, float, double type
